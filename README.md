## What is this?

This is a React UI for the [ABP Framework](https://abp.io/). We are working on a beta release and it is offically not ready for production, However, you can use it with your own risk. It uses [AbpTemplate](https://github.com/antosubash/AbpTemplate) as the backend. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
